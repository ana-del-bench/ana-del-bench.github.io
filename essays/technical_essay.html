  <p>When it comes to software engineering, I have a pretty broad range of interests including database management, web development and graphics development. However, my interests are all tied together by a much more general goal.</p>

<h2 id="not-everyone-understands-technology">Not Everyone Understands Technology</h2>

<p>It’s a running joke between my parents that my mom married into the family so that she’d have lifelong free IT service. While that initially only applied to my dad (who does work in IT), I’ve since been adopted into the role as well. While the problems that I’m enlisted to solve at home are often much simpler than the ones that would arise in a more technologically advanced environment, the principle remains the same. There are certain components of the technological world that aren’t as accessible to the public due to lack of specific knowledge or skills. Therefore, a way for these people to interact with these functions and information needs to be made, and it must be easily understandable for the general public.</p>

<p>Through various environments, I’ve experienced many different situations where I’ve acted as a go-between, explaining different programming concepts to people who needed tasks done but didn’t have the knowledge or skills to do it themselves. I’ve found that the satisfaction I receive when I can use my skills to help someone accomplish something or to make someone’s life easier is consistent throughout all of those experiences. As a result, many of the skills that I’m trying to develop are centered around things that can be used for user interface design. That’s why I’m able to pursue such a broad range of fields; because there are multiple ways to accomplish my goals that also fall within my areas of interest.</p>

<p>For instance, when it comes to database management, the goal is to manage the information within the database in a way that is useful for the people who need it. Being able to anticipate issues and design algorithms that make things like websites or database interfaces more accessible involves the exact type of problem-solving that I genuinely enjoy. It’s also the reason that I hope to gain more experience with UI (User Interface) design in the future. Furthermore, while my studies are currently centered around database management and web development, I hope to further develop the skills needed for applications like desktop programs and graphic design engines. I hold a lot of interest in the logic behind graphic design engines like Unreal Engine or Maya that have features that can take complex 3D projects and make accurate modifications in ways that can streamline production processes, so it’s a process that I’d love to learn more about in the future.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>My overarching goal has always been to be able to use my skills to help people. It’s an objective I know I can, and have, accomplished regardless of the field that I ultimately end up in. So, I’ll continue to develop my skills so that I can continue to pursue my goals.</p>
