Generally speaking, my favorite programming language is just whichever language I’m most familiar with at the moment. Sort of like a parent who refuses to pick a favorite, I don't think I'll ever be able to definitively choose one. This may or may not be a result of the fact that, the more you learn about something, the easier it is to appreciate. However, while correlation is not causation, I would like to mention that my experience with computer science professors has commonly been that they advocate whatever language they teach with as the superior one.

## Learning New Programming Languages

I’d liken my first experiences with learning about programming to being taught how to swim –by being thrown into the deep end of an olympic swimming pool. A method that, while stressful, was effective and an overall positive experience. On the other hand, the experience I’ve had learning in more formal settings has been much more gradual. To continue the swimming analogy, one can consider it akin to being thrown into a kiddie pool to begin with, and then, as you get better at swimming you’re thrown into progressively larger and deeper bodies of water. 

Not only does this fit the structure of most online coding programs (where concepts are introduced in a progressively more complex manner), this also fits my experience so far with the “athletic software engineering” learning approach used in this class. The practice exercises provide ample motivation (i.e. adrenaline) to learn the Javascript language and practice how to use it for progressively more complex projects. Coincidentally, in the case of athletic software engineering, the adrenaline of trying to finish a task correctly under a time limit just so happens to mirror, on a smaller scale, the adrenaline that comes with suddenly finding yourself in a body of water when you can’t swim. Fortunately for me (or unfortunately depending on your views on swimming), learning Javascript seems to be much more intuitive to learn than buoyancy was.

## Reflecting On Javascript

Would I currently consider Javascript to be my favorite language? No. Will it be by the end of this semester? Probably. As I said, it’s far easier to grow fond of something that you’re interacting with everyday. However, having never used Javascript prior, I did find myself often questioning how Javascript can allow so many functions that are considered forbidden in so many other languages. Being able to use multiple data types with a single array or being able to pass a variable amount of arguments into a function is (in gen-z terms) wild.

Prior to my introduction to Javascript, I was really only vaguely aware of the fact that it was used heavily in web development. With the idea of web development in mind, I can see why such a flexible language has become popular for web development. The freedom to manage inputs and outputs without having to worry about the specificities that come with working with multiple data types is enticing. Even more so, the versatility of using the “promise” object to deal with an environment that can be as unstable as the internet makes perfect logical sense. So, even though I've yet to develop a situational bias towards Javascript, I can appreciate a lot of the functionality that makes it different.
