## I. Introduction

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is integrated into education, the field must adapt to the changes that such a powerful tool brings. AI has the potential to automate progressively more complex tasks as this technology develops. For fields like software engineering, this means that (from personal experience) tools like ChatGPT or Co-Pilot are able to write code, solve problems, or even explain concepts for the programmer.

## II. Personal Experience with AI:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
    + I learn best through practice, so going through the WOds on my own was the best way to ensure that I knew the course content.

2. In-class Practice WODs
   + Class practice WODs didn’t affect our grade, so it was more beneficial to try and learn from any mistake made during the practice.

3. In-class WODs
   + I found the extra step of transferring and adapting any answer from ChatGPT unnecessary and overall less time-efficient than doing so independently.

4. Essays
   + I found the extra step of transferring and adapting any answer from ChatGPT unnecessary and overall less time-efficient than doing so independently.

5. Final project
   + ChatGPT was used to create a project outline for the project group that allowed us to determine a feasible development plan for the app features. As well as a good system for dividing up the tasks.

6. Learning a concept / tutorial
   + ChatGPT was used to generate a tutorial for porting a web application onto a mobile platform. This was a feature we wanted to implement for our HACC project and the AI was able to provide a clear foundation for the tools and steps we’d need for such a task.

7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
   + I’ve never run into such a situation, so I’m not aware of how AI would be used for something like this. At any rate, I assume that it would be much more efficient for the asker to directly address the AI application themselves.

8. Asking or answering a smart-question
   + I’m personally more inclined to solve problems independently before seeking outside help, additionally, many of my questions, when run through Google, provide a similar situation solved in forums like Stack Overflow.

9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
   + The majority of this course provided ample tutorials/resources to find useful examples for anything I needed, so I didn’t need to use AI.

10. Explaining code
    + I mainly used the resource videos to explain the code we used in class instead of AI.

11. Writing code
    + Past classes have instilled an aversion to using chatGPT for coding assignments (to avoid plagiarism) so I tend to avoid using AI for in-class coding assignments despite knowing that it’s allowed in this case.

12. Documenting code
    + I haven’t had the chance to, but ChatGPT is a useful tool for documenting code as it’s most useful for drawing information from large amounts of code, so I’d likely do so if given the chance.

13. Quality assurance
    + This wasn’t something that I had the opportunity to use AI for, but if such a situation arose I would definitely use AI as a tool as it could save a lot of debugging time.

14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
    + I occasionally use ChatGPT to generate a study-plan when I have multiple assignments to get through to keep me organized. It allows me to have a clear plan and I don't get distracted or spend an excessive amount of time making one myself.


## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

The incorporation of AI has provided access to a new level of understanding when it comes to learning. The automation of more menial problem-solving tasks allows me to focus on more complex issues that I may not already be familiar with. While such a reliance on AI may be detrimental to developing lower-level problem-solving skills, for those who already have a grasp of the basics, it’s an extremely useful tool. Additionally, the ability to use ChatGPT to provide explanations for certain concepts from multiple different angles makes it much easier to gain an understanding for software engineering concepts like those in web development through explanations and techniques that are best suited to my learning style.

## IV. Practical Applications:

One of the best features of AI applications like ChatGPT is the versatility that it offers. Outside of the classroom, AI is being used in real-world applications to broaden the capabilities of such applications. For example, one of the HACC challenges for the 2023 competition involved using AI to optimize the searching feature for the UH ITS database. In this case, AI was being used to filter search results beyond the restrictions of a keyword search. 

## V. Challenges and Opportunities:

When it comes to applications like GitHub Co-Pilot that are specifically designed for programming purposes, the results returned aren’t always perfect. When receiving assistance in writing code from scratch, it’s most likely that the results will require debugging. The more complex of a task you’re trying to accomplish, the higher the likelihood that errors will occur. So, while AI applications are adept at providing simpler code, they’re not as reliable when it comes to larger problems. However, as the technology is refined, such applications could become the standard for producing the more generic algorithms that are standard across multiple projects, allowing developers to build on a pre-made foundation.

## VI. Comparative Analysis:

Traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches each come with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. An AI-enhanced approach is capable of diversifying lesson plans in a way that can be tailored to each student and their needs. Students will also benefit from the assistance of AI generation in a way that allows them to focus more on the intended concept rather than being held-up dealing with smaller unrelated errors. However, by allowing AI to do these menial tasks, students may have a harder time building up these foundational skills that come with repetition and experience. On the other hand, traditional teaching methods provide ample opportunity for students to practice and gain experience with the subject matter. Additionally, problem-solving often requires a person to have a solid understanding of the concepts that they’re working with, the application of which helps with retention.

## VII. Future Considerations:

We are transitioning into an age where the use of AI is becoming increasingly common. Similar to past technological advancements like personal computers and the internet, this new technology will also have to be incorporated into a students curriculum. If anything, it’s going to become pertinent that students learn how to use such a powerful tool responsibly. While AI has the potential to be a valuable tool in code-generation, be that as an example to learn from or as something similar to the templates used in ICS 314, it also has the potential to take over tasks that would have provided valuable experience for the student.

## VIII. Conclusion:

Overall, I think that allowing the use of AI for this course was a good way to deal with the inevitable that it would happen regardless of whether it was allowed or not. Through this approach, we’re able to openly navigate the balance between using AI as a tool and using it as a crutch. At this developmental stage, AI is pretty much unregulated, which is something that may change in the future as it becomes more capable. So, software engineering education is going to have to find approaches like the one taken in this course that can  incorporate this technology into the general curriculum without it taking over and turning such education into what is effectively copy and pasting.
